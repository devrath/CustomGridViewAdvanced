## Project Observations

* Android has a widget called `gridView`, what this widget does is it scrolls a collection of images `vertically` but most of the times we need to do more than that.

* `Listview` comes with a built-in `header` and `footer` and we can add them by adding few lines of code but same thing cannot be done for a `gridview`.

* In this project we are adding a `header` and `footer` to a `gridview`

* This project id developed so that user can add `row-wise` widgets for example, we can add a `sub-header` and a `collection of views` again a new `sub-header` further collection of views.

* These customizations help in creating `categorized gridView`
